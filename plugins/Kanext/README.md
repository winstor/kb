# Kanext

> Improved and expanded theme for [kanboard](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard), that alters both look and functionality.

## Important notice

Version 3.x.x brings more fundamental changes to the project, thus please do not update if you are happy previous versions.

## Kanext theme

`Kanext` is short for `Kanboard-Extended` :) . This plugin is supposed to change some parts of the templates kanboard uses (e.g. the dashboard) to increase productivity for small teams.

Other UI improvements are available as well:

- different menu structure;
- just another CSS theme;
- small changes in the overall functionality (e.g. close modal on outside click, close dropdown on second click in the anchor)

For now, `Kanext` contains a lot of functionality - this is convenient, as it is rather easy to mentain. In the future, it might be broken into smaller plugins.

## Screenshot

This screenshot is made together with the **GreenWing** plugin/template, which we strongle recommend.

## Kanboard

Kanboard provides the basic necessary functionality for handling kanban projects. Moreover, it is a popular piece of software with a lot of community support.
Kanboard is currently at **1.2.13**.

## Closing notes

The issues are being taken into consideration. Due to this being a spare-spare time project, it might take a while until they are adressed. Sorry for that! :)
